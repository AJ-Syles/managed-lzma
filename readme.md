This project provides a translation of the LZMA SDK, including both the LZMA and LZMA2 algorithms as well as the 7zip container format in fully managed C#

The current state is working but the semi-automatic translation is still showing in a lot of places. Long term goals are clean up and optimization of the codebase and better integration into the managed world.

The current API and implementation is not stable and subject to change during the cleanup process.
